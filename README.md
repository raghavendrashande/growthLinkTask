# growthLinkTask
A repository of the task given by  GrowthLink for Intern position
This project is a machine learning model that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic based on available dataset features. The dataset is preprocessed, and a RandomForestClassifier is trained and tested for performance.

ðŸ“Œ Features Used for Prediction

Pclass (Passenger class)

Sex (Encoded as 0 = male, 1 = female)

Age (Missing values filled with random values between mean Â± standard deviation)

SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)

Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)

Fare (Ticket fare, standardized)

Deck (Extracted from Cabin, encoded as numerical categories)

Embarked (Encoded as categorical values)

ðŸš€ Steps to Run the Project

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/raghavendrashande/growthLinkTask

Run the Model

python titanicSurvivalPrediction.ipynb

Evaluate Performance

The accuracy score will be displayed after training.

Feature importance can be analyzed to understand the most influential variables.

ðŸ“‰ Why Limit max_depth and n_estimators?

The dataset contains only 320 training samples after preprocessing.

Too many estimators (n_estimators) or deep trees (max_depth) can lead to overfitting, where the model memorizes training data instead of generalizing.

Optimal settings:

max_depth=5: Ensures the trees are not too complex.

n_estimators=25: Keeps ensemble size manageable while maintaining predictive power.

Using cross-validation instead of a single test split helps verify model generalization.

ðŸ›  Future Improvements

Experiment with other classifiers like Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting.

Implement hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

Use cross-validation to validate the model instead of a single test split.
